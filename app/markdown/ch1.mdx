# The Center and Development

- Every peice should be developed in one move.
- When we develop a piece and at the same time put one of our opponentâ€™s pieces under attack, we **force him to waste time** with a piece he has already moved.
- Exchanging with resulting gain of tempo.
- Exchange, intermezzo, win of tempo.
- Liquidation, with subsequent development or a subsequent liberation.
- Keep center intact.
- No pawn hunting in the opening.
- Always capture a center pawn if this can be done without too great a danger.
