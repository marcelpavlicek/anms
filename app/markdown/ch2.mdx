# Open Files

- Post your pieces centrally as long as you can do so safely (not provoking the advance of a pawn-roller)! In this way your opponent will quite often be provoked into an exchange that will give you an _open file_.
- Piece is elastic; it is only pawn that is obstinate.
- File that is to be opened is always the file next to the point of attack.
