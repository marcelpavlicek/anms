# Open Files

- Post your pieces centrally as long as you can do so safely (not provoking the advance of a pawn-roller)! In this way your opponent will quite often be provoked into an exchange that will give you an _open file_.
- Piece is elastic; it is only pawn that is obstinate.
- File that is to be opened is always the file next to the point of attack.
- The ideal of every operation along a file lies in the ultimate penetration along the path of this line into the opponentâ€™s position, hence the 7th or 8th rank.
- In the case of inadequate resistance (that is, no enemy pawn on h6 or h5), the attacker, after securing the squares to be invaded, penetrates into the 7th or 8th rank.
- First, we try the concentric attack, attacking the obstructing pawn with several pieces. Afterwards we will look inter alia for a possibility of a powerful breakthrough.
